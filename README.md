## 💕 Valentine's Website

A fun, interactive Valentine's Day website with animated buttons and special effects!

### Features ✨
- **Growing Yes Button**: Every time "No" is clicked, the "Yes" button grows bigger
- **Thanos Snap Effect**: When "Yes" is clicked, the "No" button disappears with a snapping animation
- **Popup Message**: A celebratory popup appears when "Yes" is clicked saying "Yeheey! Don't be late!"
- **Video Player**: Center video of Bubu and Dudu
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **Beautiful Gradients**: Modern gradient backgrounds and button designs

### How to Use 🚀

1. Replace `video.mp4` with your actual video file (can be MP4, WebM, or OGG format)
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Share the link with your girlfriend!

### File Structure
```
valentine/
├── index.html      # Main HTML file
├── styles.css      # All styling and animations
├── script.js       # Interactive JavaScript
├── video.mp4       # Your Bubu and Dudu video (replace this)
└── README.txt      # This file
```

### How It Works 🎮
